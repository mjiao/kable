A tool to manage kubernetes specs in a GitOps fashion.

It reads so-called "concepts" (see [terminology](#terminology)), and renders them into various deployable formats. (YAML Manifests, GitOps controller instructions, helm charts, etc.)

## Install 

**macOS**

brew install kable
```

**Others**

Download the binaries from *Releases*, and install to a directory on your path.

### Terminology

**Concept**

A *concept* is a blueprint of an app. It is written in a specific language can be rendered to various outputs.

Supported Types:
* Jsonnet
* JavaScript/Typescript (upcoming)

Each concept needs to build on its own, that's why there is no dependency concept in kable. If let's say a Jsonnet concept depends on another Jsonnet concept, this should be realized via the Jsonnet-specific package management.

**Repo** 

*Repos* are git repositories that contain multiple concepts. They are used as a platform for exchange of concepts, and to render concepts from.

**Rendering**

*Rendering*, means to instantiate a concept. It's "Application" so to say. Multiple output targets supported.

Supported Targets:
* YAML
* FluxCD Application (upcoming)
* Kable Application (upcoming)
