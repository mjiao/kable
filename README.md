### Concept

A concept is a blueprint of an app. It is written in a specific language can be rendered to various outputs.

Supported Types:
* Jsonnet
* JavaScript/Typescript (upcoming)

Each concept needs to build on its own, that's why there is no dependency concept in kable. If let's say a Jsonnet concept depends on another Jsonnet concept, this should be realized via the Jsonnet-specific package management.

### App

An app is an instance of a concept, it's "Application" so to say. An App specifically is rendered from a concept. Multiple output targets are supported.

Supported Targets:
* YAML
* Argo Applicaiton (upcoming)
* FluxCD Application (upcoming)

### Repo 

A repo is a git repository which contains an index of concepts at its root. Thus, a repo can serve as a platform for exchange of concepts.
